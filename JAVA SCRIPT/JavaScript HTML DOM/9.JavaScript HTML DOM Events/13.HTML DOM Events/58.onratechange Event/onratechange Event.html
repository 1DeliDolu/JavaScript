      In this example, we assign an "onratechange" event to a video element. The
      playbackRate property is used to change the playing speed of the video.
    </p>

    <video
      id="myVideo"
      width="320"
      height="240"
      autoplay
      controls
      onratechange="myFunction()"
    >
      <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
      Your browser does not support the video tag.</video
    ><br />

    <button onclick="setPlaySpeed()" type="button">
      Set video to be play in slow motion
    </button>

    <script>
      // Get the video element with id="myVideo"
      var x = document.getElementById("myVideo");

      // Set the current playback speed of the video to 0.3 (slow motion)
      function setPlaySpeed() {
        x.playbackRate = 0.3;
      }

      // Alert some text when the playing speed of the video is changed
      function myFunction() {
        alert("The playing speed of the video was changed");
      }
    </script>
