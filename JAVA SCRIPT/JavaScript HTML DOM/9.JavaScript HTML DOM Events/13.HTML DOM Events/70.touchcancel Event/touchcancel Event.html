    <h1>DOM touchcancel Event</h1>

    <p ontouchcancel="myFunction()">
      Touch this paragraph while you do something that will interrupt the event.
      Different devices will interrupt the touch at different actions, so this
      example can be difficult to demonstrate, but it is considered good
      practice to include this event.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This example is for touch devices only.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Touch Cancelled";
      }
