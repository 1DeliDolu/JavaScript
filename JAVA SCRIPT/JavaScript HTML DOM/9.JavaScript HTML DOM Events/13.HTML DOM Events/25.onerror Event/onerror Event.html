    <p>
      A function is triggered if an error occurs when loading the image. The
      function shows an alert box with a text. In this example we refer to an
      image that does not exist, therefore the onerror event occurs.
    </p>

    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        alert("The image could not be loaded.");
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
