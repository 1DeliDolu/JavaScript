    <h1>The Storage Event</h1>

    <p>
      The Storage Event is triggered when there is a change in the window's
      storage area.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The storage event is only triggered when a window
      <strong>other than itself</strong> makes the changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, in this example, a new window is created, and the changes is
      done in the new window.
    </p>

    <h1>The key Property</h1>

    <p>
      The key property belongs to the Storage Event object, and returns the name
      of the item that was changed.
    </p>

    <button onclick="changeValue()">Change a Storage Item</button>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      window.addEventListener("storage", myFunction);

      function myFunction(event) {
        var x = "Key: " + event.key;
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
      }

      function changeValue() {
        var x = window.open("", "myWindow", "width=200,height=100");
        x.localStorage.setItem("mytime", Date.now());
        x.close();
      }
    </script>
