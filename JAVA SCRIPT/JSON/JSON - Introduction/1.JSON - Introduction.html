JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand  
    </p>

It defines an object with 3 properties:

name
age
car
Each property has a value.

If you parse the JSON string with a JavaScript program, you can access the data as an object:
<b style="color: violet;">let</b> personName = obj.name;
<b style="color: violet;">let</b> personAge = obj.age;
        </pre>

      <pre>
What is JSON?
    #JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
    #JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
    #JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
    #JSON is used to send data between computers
    #JSON is language independent *  
<span>*
The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation, but the JSON format is text only.
Code for reading and generating JSON exists in many programming languages.</span>          
        </pre>
<pre>
Why Use JSON?
    #The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.
    #Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.         
    JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:
            
    <b style="color:red;">JSON.parse()</b>
    JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:
    <b style="color:red;">JSON.stringify()</b>

<span>You can receive pure text from a server and use it as a JavaScript object.
You can send a JavaScript object to a server in pure text format.
You can work with data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.</span>

Storing Data
When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats.
JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.
