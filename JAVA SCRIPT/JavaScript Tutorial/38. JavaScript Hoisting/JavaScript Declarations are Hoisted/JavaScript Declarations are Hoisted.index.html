      In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In other
      words; a variable can be used before it has been declared. Example 1 gives
      the same result as Example 2:
    </p>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

      elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
      elem.innerHTML = x; // Display x in the element

      var x; // Declare x
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
